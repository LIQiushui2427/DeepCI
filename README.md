# DeepCI

## Introduction

This is implementation of a Paper DeepCI, which is accepted by the [ICRBME 2023](https://www.icrbme.org/).
It is about a new method to estimate the demand function in differenciated product markets using unsupervised machine learning.
The full paper is available [here](./DeepCI.pdf) in project root directory.

## Requirements

* Python 3.6 and above

## Description

This project uses a DeepCI estimator to simulate the demand in differenciated product markets.
The model use a neural network to estimate the demand function.

## Roadmap
