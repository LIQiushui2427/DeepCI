# Introduction

Code for replication of experiments in the paper:

Dikkala, Nishanth, Greg Lewis, Lester Mackey, and Vasilis Syrgkanis. "Minimax estimation of conditional moment models." arXiv preprint arXiv:2006.07201 (2020).

https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.07201

# Installation

Before running any script you need to install the mliv package by running:

```
python setup.py develop
```

The main dependencies of the package are, cvxopt, scikit-learn, numpy, pytorch.

cvxopt is installed by running the setup.py command above. The rest need to be installed independently.

# MLIV Package

This will install the package `mliv` on your python environment, which contains all the non-parametric instrumental variable estimators proposed in the paper. It contains the components:
* `mliv.rkhs`: estimators based on Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces. See [RKHS Notebook](local_notebooks/RkhsExamples.ipynb) for example usage.
* `mliv.linear`: estimators based on high-dimensional sparse linear represetations. See [Sparse Linear Notebook](local_notebooks/SparseLinearExamples.ipynb) for example usage.
* `mliv.ensemble`: estimators based on random forests. See [Random Forest Notebook](local_notebooks/EnsemblesExamples.ipynb) for example usage.
* `mliv.neuralnet`: estimators based on neural nets, using pytorch. See [Neural Net Notebook](local_notebooks/NeuralNetExamples.ipynb) and [MNIST Experiments Notebook](local_notebooks/MNIST_Experiments.ipynb) for example usage.
* `mliv.shape`: estimators based on shape constraints. See [Shape Constraints Notebook](local_notebooks/ShapeExamples.ipynb) for example usage.

# Table Generation for Non-Image Experiments

To generate figures that are not related to the mnist experiments you need to run:
```
cd montecarlo
chmod +x local_script.sh
local_script.sh {config_file}
```
where config file is different for each figure. The above is for windows. For linux replace `local_script.sh` with
`local_script_linux.sh` and for Mac replace it with `local_script_osx.sh`. Results are saved in a .csv file with the
corresponding name. 

* To generate Figure 14:
```
local_script.sh ivconfig_one_z_one_t_paper_n_300_gamma_6
```
* To generate Figure 15:
```
local_script.sh ivconfig_one_z_one_t_paper_n_2000_gamma_6
```
* To generate Figure 16:
```
local_script.sh ivconfig_one_z_one_t_paper_n_2000_gamma_8
```
* To generate Figure 17:
```
local_script.sh ivconfig_many_z_one_t_paper_n_z_5
```
* To generate Figure 18:
```
local_script.sh ivconfig_many_z_one_t_paper_n_z_10
```
* To generate Figure 19:
```
local_script.sh ivconfig_many_z_many_t_paper_n_z_5
```
* To generate Figure 20:
```
local_script.sh ivconfig_many_z_many_t_paper_n_z_10
```
* To generate Figure 21:
```
local_script.sh ivconfig_many_z_many_t_nnet_paper
```
* To generate Figure 22:
```
local_script.sh ivconfig_high_dim_paper
local_script.sh ivconfig_very_high_dim_paper
```
In this case the results are stored in the "print_metrics.csv" file of the newly created folders: `highdimlin` and
`veryhighdimlin`.

These experiments were run on a CPU cluster within a linux environment and parallelism over 1000 cores.

# Table Generation for MNIST experiments

To generate the mnist results, from the main folder run:
```
chmod +x run_mnist_experiments.sh
./run_mnist_experiments.sh"
```

These experiments were run on a single linux GPU node.

# Further Examples

Further examples on how to use the methods and run single instances can be found in the folder `local_notebooks`. Each
notebook contains examples from each part of the library (RandomForests, NeuralNets, RKHS, SparseLinear, ShapeConstraints).

# Third-Party Material

The folder `deepgmm` contains a frozen copy of the git repo https://github.com/CausalML/DeepGMM that contains the code
from the prior work of Bennet et al. Deep Generalized Method of Moments for Instrumental Variable Analysis.

The code in `mliv/neuralnet/oadam.py` and `mliv/neuralnet/rbflayer.py` is forked and modified from the repository:
